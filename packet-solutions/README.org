* Solutions

** Packet01: packet parsing

*** Assignment 1: Fix the bounds checking error

See the =parse_ethhdr= function from the [[file:../common/parsing_helpers.h][parsing_helpers.h]] file.

*** Assignment 2: Parsing the IP header

See the =parse_ip6hdr= function from the [[file:../common/parsing_helpers.h][parsing_helpers.h]] file.

*** Assignment 3: Parsing the ICMPv6 header and reacting to it

See the =parse_icmp6hdr= function from the [[file:../common/parsing_helpers.h][parsing_helpers.h]]
file.  The sequence number should be accessed as =bpf_ntohs(icmp6h->icmp6_sequence)=
as it is a 2-byte value in the network order.

*** Assignment 4: Adding VLAN support

See the =parse_ethhdr= function from the [[file:../common/parsing_helpers.h][parsing_helpers.h]] file.

*** Assignment 5: Adding IPv4 support

See the =parse_iphdr= and =parse_icmphdr= functions from the [[file:../common/parsing_helpers.h][parsing_helpers.h]] file.

** Packet02: packet rewriting

*** Assignment 1: Rewrite port numbers

An example XDP program can be found in the =xdp_patch_ports= section in the [[file:xdp_prog_kern_02.c][xdp_prog_kern_02.c]] file. The program will decrease by one destination port number in any TCP or UDP packet.

=fix_port_egress= section in the [[file:tc_reply_kern_02.c][tc_reply_kern_02.c]] file will increase by one source port number in reply packet.

Steps to do before generate traffic:
tc qdisc add dev eth0 clsact
tc filter add dev eth0 egress bpf da obj tc_reply_kern_02.o sec tc
tc filter show dev eth0 egress

Clean qdisc clsact:
tc qdisc del dev eth0 clsact

*** Assignment 2: Remove the outermost VLAN tag

See the =vlan_tag_pop= function from the [[file:../common/rewrite_helpers.h][rewrite_helpers.h]] file.
An example XDP program can be found in the =xdp_vlan_swap= section in the [[file:xdp_prog_kern_02.c][xdp_prog_kern_02.c]] file.

*** Assignment 3: Add back a missing VLAN tag

See the =vlan_tag_push= function from the [[file:../common/rewrite_helpers.h][rewrite_helpers.h]] file.
An example XDP program can be found in the =xdp_vlan_swap= section in the [[file:xdp_prog_kern_02.c][xdp_prog_kern_02.c]] file.

** Packet03: redirecting packets

*** Assignment 1: Send packets back where they came from

See the =xdp_icmp_echo= program in the [[file:xdp_prog_kern_03.c][xdp_prog_kern_03.c]] file.

*** Assignment 2: Redirect packets between two interfaces

See the =xdp_redirect= program in the [[file:xdp_prog_kern_03.c][xdp_prog_kern_03.c]] file.

*** Assignment 3: Extend to a bidirectional router

See the =xdp_redirect_map= program in the [[file:xdp_prog_kern_03.c][xdp_prog_kern_03.c]] file.
User space part of the assignment is implemented in the [[file:xdp_prog_user.c][xdp_prog_user.c]] file.

*** Assignment 4: Use the BPF helper for routing

See the =xdp_router= program in the [[file:xdp_prog_kern_03.c][xdp_prog_kern_03.c]] file.
User space part of the assignment is implemented in the [[file:xdp_prog_user.c][xdp_prog_user.c]] file.
